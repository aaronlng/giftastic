# Giftastic

This is a project based on the Giphy API which allows the user to add a topic using the theme created and create a button using the form. Once the button is created you can click on the button and pull the top 10 gifs from Giphy to the web page. It will display the rating and when the icons are clicked on will start or stop the motion of the gif.
